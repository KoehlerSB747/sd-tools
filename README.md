# sd-tools
Java "Semantic Discovery" tools for AI with emphasis in NLP and ML

This is a repository for general domain agnostic utilities and frameworks upon which domain specific solutions can be built. Using the abstraction of an expert system as an analogy, this toolkit represents components of and for the inference engine but not necessarily its domain-specific knowledge modules.

The main purpose of this project is to bootstrap the development of modular solutions to real world problems using artificial intelligence techniques.
