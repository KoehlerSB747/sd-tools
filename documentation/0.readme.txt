    - git clone git@github.com:KoehlerSB747/sd-tools.git

(2) Build
    - mvn clean package javadoc:javadoc

(3) Execute
    - To execute a class without any dependencies (for example):
      - using the built jar:
        - java -classpath ./target/sd-tools-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.sd.util.AsciiTable
      - using the compiled classes:
        - java -classpath ./target/classes org.sd.util.AsciiTable
    - To execute any class with or without dependencies (for example):
      - java -classpath ./target/classes:`mvn -o dependency:build-classpath | grep ^/ | head -n1` org.sd.util.AsciiTable
    - Note that to include all dependencies in an "uber" jar, you could build using maven's "shade" packaging type in the pom.
      - Since the classes here are intended for use as tools in other projects, this has intentionally been omitted.
      - For running and/or testing utilities more conveniently, see the develop notes below which include helper scripts.
